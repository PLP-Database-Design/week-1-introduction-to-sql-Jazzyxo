1. State and Explain the components of a DBMS(Database Management System)
- Hardware
Physical components of the computer system, such as the CPU, memory, and storage devices.
Provides the necessary resources to process and store data.

- Software
Instructions and programs that run on the hardware to manage the database.
Includes the DBMS software itself, as well as operating system and utility programs.

- Data
The actual information stored in the database.
Can include a wide range of data types, such as numbers, text, images, and multimedia.

- Procedures
Instructions that define how data is processed and manipulated.
Examples include stored procedures, triggers, and database functions.

- Database Access Language (DAL)
A language used to communicate with the DBMS and manipulate data.
Allows users to create, read, update, and delete data in the database.
Examples include SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL query languages.

2. A relational database is a type of database that organizes data into tables (also known as relations), which consist of rows and columns. Each table has a unique name and is structured to hold data about a specific subject. Relationships between tables are established through the use of primary keys and foreign keys, enabling efficient querying and management of data. Relational databases rely on Structured Query Language (SQL) for defining, querying, and managing the data.

MySQL
A widely used open-source relational database known for its speed, reliability, and ease of use.
Popular in web applications, such as WordPress and e-commerce platforms.

PostgreSQL
An advanced open-source relational database with powerful features, including support for complex queries and JSON data.
Commonly used in enterprise applications and data analysis.

Microsoft SQL Server
A relational database developed by Microsoft, designed for large-scale enterprise use with strong integration into Microsoft tools.
Used in industries like finance, healthcare, and logistics.

Oracle Database
A commercial relational database known for its robustness, scalability, and advanced security features.
Often used in large-scale enterprise environments such as banking and telecommunications.

3.  Data Definition Language (DDL)
DDL statements are used to define and manage the structure of a database, including tables, schemas, and relationships.

- Data Manipulation Language (DML)
DML statements are used to manipulate the actual data stored in the database.

- Data Query Language (DQL)
DQL statements are used to retrieve data from the database based on specified conditions.

4. Uniqueness:
A primary key ensures that each record in the table is unique and cannot have duplicate values.
A foreign key can have duplicate values because it references multiple records in another table.

Nullability:
A primary key cannot contain NULL values, as it must uniquely identify every record.
A foreign key can contain NULL values, unless explicitly defined as NOT NULL.

Purpose:
The primary key serves to uniquely identify each record within its own table.
The foreign key establishes a relationship between two tables by referring to the primary key in another table.

Number per Table:
A primary key can only appear once in a table, as there is only one unique identifier per table.
A foreign key can appear multiple times in a table, as it links to different records in another table.

Example Usage:
A primary key might be the id column in a Users table, which uniquely identifies each user.
A foreign key might be the user_id column in an Orders table, which references the id column in the Users table to indicate which user placed the order.

5. An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) is a visual representation of the relationships between entities (objects or concepts) in a database system. It is used in database design to model the structure of data and to illustrate how different entities interact with each other. ERDs are essential for understanding the database schema and its relationships, and they help in organizing and structuring data effectively.

6.  Data Integrity
Relational databases enforce rules like primary keys and foreign keys, ensuring that data is consistent and accurate. This helps prevent data redundancy and maintains relationships between tables.
2. Ease of Use
Relational databases use Structured Query Language (SQL), which is easy to learn and use for querying and managing data. SQL provides a powerful, standard way to retrieve and manipulate data across different database systems.
3. Flexibility
Data in a relational database is organized into tables (or relations) with rows and columns, allowing for flexible querying. Users can add, update, or delete data in different tables without affecting others, as long as the relationships are properly defined.
4. Scalability
Relational databases can handle large amounts of data and are capable of scaling to meet the growing needs of applications. They support indexing and optimizations to improve performance as the size of the data grows.

7. Integer
   Date
   Float
   Varchar

8. The purpose of a Database Management System (DBMS) is to provide a systematic way to store, manage, and retrieve data efficiently. It serves as an intermediary between users and databases, ensuring data integrity, security, and ease of access.
